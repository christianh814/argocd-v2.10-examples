# Argo CD 2.10 Examples
## Apps in Any Namespace & Notifications
> With the recent introduction of apps-in-any-namespace in version 2.5, users can now self-serve their apps. This has been a major improvement, allowing users to create, deploy, and manage their own apps across multiple namespaces.
> 
> Now, with the addition of the new self-serve notifications configuration feature, users can take even greater control of their appsâ€™ settings. End-users have the ability to configure notifications for their Argo CD application in their namespaces, without having to rely on Argo CD admins to make these changes.
